## TODO

### Core

- [x] AIG Node class
- [x] AIG.hpp (node)
- [x] Parsing AAG (ASCII)
- [x] Verify counts & topological order
- [x] Resolve TODOS
- [x] Test and.aig (check inputs, ouputs, fan-ins of gates)  
- [x] show depth 
- [ ] show fan-out analysis


### Goals + Extensions

- [ ] Structural hashing (replace naive push_back with a unique-table)
- [ ] Very basic optimization (remove duplicate nodes)
- [ ] Graph export/print and pretty printing (Hard)
- [ ] Bliff support (write_aig_blif) (very easy now we have boolean generation)
- [ ] Import / Parse bliff
- [ ] Export / Save to bliff
- [ ] Binary AIG Support (read_aiger_binary)
